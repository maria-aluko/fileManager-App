# A simple file uploading app

## App

This app is built as a group assignment in our TypeScript class to practice TypeScript and group work.

## How it is built and how it works

Built in TypeScript. Styling in Tailwind.

Users can:

- Create an account
- Log in with an existing account
- View and delete their files
- Upload new files
- Create folders and move files within them
- Mark files as favorites and filter based on that

API: https://unelmacloud.com/api-docs

## Future Enhancements:

- sharing option
- automatically sorting functionality to sort the files to the right category
- opening the folder shows all the files with a blurry preview
- opening the file with the corresponding "program" its built in in unelma cloud - pops up as an overlay
- shows image in original size
